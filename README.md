# zoomerlib
A library to help zoomers learn C
### The problem
Zoomers are the generation that at this point might be the most technologically illiterate. They are possibly even below boomers. See [this](https://www.pcgamer.com/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say/) article to see just how large the scope of the problem is.
### The solution
It is obvious that most zoomers are completely incapable of understanding programming languages. That is why this library aims to bring C closer to zoomers by adopting their language in C syntax. It will make C the first zoomer friendly language in the world.
### Contributions
If anybody wishes to contribute, or has any ideas for new defines and inclusion of zoomer slang, that is always welcome
